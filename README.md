# Regression-Model-with-Keras
Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction 🏗️🔬 A Deep Learning project using Keras to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its material composition and curing age. This project demonstrates how neural networks can be used in CE to estimate concrete strength, aiding in construction quality control and material optimization.
